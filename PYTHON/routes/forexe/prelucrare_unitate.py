Resolving the UNIT (and, through it, the classification) of a FOREXE indicator --
step 2 of the ingest, and the operator round trip that happens when the answer is
not unique. Slice 0048-02; plan docs/PLAN_ForexeIngest.md sections 5.2a / 7 step 2,

WHAT THIS PORTS
---------------
`Obtine_IdUnitate_Din` in mdl_FX_Tasks_Receive_DWN, verbatim:

    SELECT CG.IdUnitate, Cai.AlteDetalii, Count(CG.IdUnitate) as Cnt
      FROM ClasificatiiG AS CG INNER JOIN Cai ON CG.IdUnitate = Cai.IdUnitate
     WHERE SS = '<SS>' AND ClsfE = '<Right(ClsfE,8) without dots>'
       AND Cai.DC = '<DC()>'
     GROUP BY CG.IdUnitate, Cai.AlteDetalii

    0 rows  -> FX_IdUnitate = -1, returns False -> the caller GoTo Iesire, so the
               whole of Prelucrare_Indicatori ends WITHOUT success. A blocking error.
    1 row   -> that IdUnitate.
    n rows  -> DoCmd.OpenForm "FX_Unitate", ..., acDialog  -- Access ASKED THE
               OPERATOR, modally, every single time, and used whatever they picked.

So the ambiguity is not new and it is not a defect: the Access system had a dialog
for it. What K-BOT adds is that the question travels over HTTP (the server cannot
open a window on the operator's screen) and that the operator may tick a box to
stop being asked for that one pair.

THE MariaDB TRANSLATION
-----------------------
  * `ClasificatiiG` (an Access query over Clasificatii) -> `Clasificatii`.
  * `Cai` was the Access registry of unit databases; its `DC` column named the
    database. On MariaDB one database IS one unit set, so the `Cai.DC = DC()`
    filter is implicit -- we are already connected to that database -- and the
    INNER JOIN moves to `Unitati`, which is the per-database unit list.
  * `Cai.AlteDetalii` ('LOCAL' / 'ISJ' / 'VEN' ...) was NOT migrated: see
    docs/MAPARE_NOMENCLATOARE.md section 2, where only IdUnitate / NumeUnitate /
    SURSA reach `Unitati`. The readable label is therefore `Unitati.Detalii`
    (= `cai.NumeUnitate`), which is the better label anyway -- it is the same text
    the operator picks from in the migrator's unit list.
  * The INNER JOIN is kept deliberately: `Clasificatii.IdUnitate` is NULLable, and
    a classification with no unit cannot answer "which unit", so it drops out --
    exactly as it dropped out of the Access join.

No `LIMIT 1` anywhere in this file. The read routes use `LIMIT 1` over the same
nomenclator because picking either duplicate only changes a label; here it would
attach an indicator to the wrong subunit, and nothing would surface for months.

HOW TO READ THIS FILE (the operator asked for this explicitly -- comments say WHAT
a line does, not only why; the reader knows SQL and VB.NET, not Python):

  * `Tuple[str, str]`      an immutable pair. Used as a dictionary KEY here -- a
                           list cannot be one, a tuple can.
  * `dict.get(k)`          returns None instead of raising when the key is absent.
  * `set`                  a dictionary with keys and no values; `x in s` is fast.
  * `raise X(...) from err` re-raise as a different type while KEEPING the original
                           exception chained underneath. Never loses the cause.
  * `%s`                   the SQL parameter placeholder. The driver escapes the
                           value. Never build SQL with f-strings.
