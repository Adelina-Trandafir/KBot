# routes/forexe/budget_on_day.py
"""
The budget of a classification ON A DAY (slice 0102) -- what the fundamentation document (DDF)
shows as «Buget» and measures «Valoare ramasa» against.

WHY IT EXISTS. What FOREXE reports (`FX_Indicatori_Buget.CreditBugetar`, one row per classification,
since slice 0108) only holds what FOREXE says TODAY. After a budget
rectification an old reservation measured against today's smaller budget came out negative. The
DDF has to use the budget the classification had on the revision's date.

THE RULE (operator, 02.10.2026; the quarters dropped 03.10.2026, slice 0108)
  1. Version: among the `Clasificatii_Buget` rows of the classification for the year of the day
     (`An = YEAR(day)`), the one with the greatest `DataInceput <= day`. None -> no budget.
  2. Rectifications: the `Clasificatii_Rectificari` rows of the classification dated from the
     version's `DataInceput` up to the day, both included. They are NOT budget; each one changes
     the quarter(s) whose `TrimN` it carries. A rectification older than the version is already
     inside the version and is left out.
  3. The result is the TOTAL of the version (Trim1 + Trim2 + Trim3 + Trim4) plus the total of
     every one of its rectifications. NO quarter cut-off: a version that starts on 01.04 with
     Trim1..4 = 100, 200, 300, 400 gives 1000 on every day from 01.04 on, whatever the day's
     quarter (operator, 03.10.2026). Before slice 0108 the sum stopped at the quarter of the day
     and the Migrator split the opening budget by 12; the opening budget now goes whole on
     Trim1, so the quarters carry no meaning of their own.

`None` means the day has no budget version; the caller keeps today's FOREXE credit (`FX_Indicatori_Buget`) and tells
the operator so. This module never decides that fallback.
